<!-- Another bug reported by Ivan Konobeev.  A position with nothing but PNTM -->
<!-- wins and at least some discarded futuremoves will be flagged as a draw, -->
<!-- due to finalize_futuremove()'s failure to properly decrement movecnt. -->

<!-- To test this bug, we need a prune that might be handled by a futurebase -->
<!-- (to avoid optimization), but that isn't actually handled, to force a commit -->
<!-- in finalize_futuremove().  Then we want a position that is lost for every -->
<!-- possible move except (maybe) a pruned move.  So, in this test case, we -->
<!-- have a futurebase (r879a) with the white rook restricted to the queen -->
<!-- side of the board.  We want a position with white to move, where taking -->
<!-- the black rook is possible but leads to a position with the white rook -->
<!-- on the king side (thus not in the futurebase) and every other move -->
<!-- is a loss for white.  I picked 8/8/8/8/3k4/8/7K/4R2r w -->

<!-- We also need combinadic3 instead of combinadic4 to avoid optimizing out -->
<!-- side-to-move, which would cause krk to backprop into the test position. -->
