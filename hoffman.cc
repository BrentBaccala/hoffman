 *
 * INTRODUCTION
 *
 * This program calculates chess tablebases, which are large files containing all possible
 * configurations of chess pieces in an endgame and the best play to either win or draw.  Unlike a
 * conventional chess engine, which uses a heuristic evaluation function, a retrograde engine is
 * almost completely non-heuristic.  When it labels a position as a win, it is because it has
 * considered all possibles lines, be they 10, 20, or 100 moves long, and determined that the win is
 * forced, even with best play by the opposing side.  Some chess-like games, such as the Japanese
 * game Shogi, are not suitable for retrograde analysis because pieces never leave the game
 * (captured pieces in Shogi can be put back into play by the capturing player).  Yet for chess, the
 * frequent reduction of games to positions where only a handful of pieces remain has created an
 * entire subfield of endgame analysis.
 *
 * Systematic analysis of chess endgames dates at least to the ninth century.  Pioneering work in
 * computer retrograde analysis was done in the 1980s by Ken Thompson, the same of UNIX fame, and
 * S.J. Edwards, but the most popular tablebases today are those generated by a program written by
 * E.V. Nalimov.  Suffice it to say that while Nalimov's program has completely solved all chess
 * endgames with six or fewer pieces remaining, and while Nalimov tablebases are widely available on
 * the Internet, the Nalimov approach of solving an endgame completely results in very slow run
 * times and exceptionally large tablebases.  The K+P+P vs K+P endgame, for example, due to the
 * possibility of all pawns queening, requires the K+Q+Q vs K+Q endgame to be solved before it can
 * be calculated.
 *
 * Hoffman takes a somewhat different approach, one pioneered by the commercial program Freezer.
 * When faced with something like K+P+P vs K+P, rather than calculate all possible resulting
 * positions, it may ignore the possibility of more than two pawns queening at the same time, thus
 * computing nothing more complex than K+Q+P vs K+Q.  While incomplete, such a tablebase is
 * nevertheless useful.  For the player with two pawns, if the tablebase finds a winning line
 * subject to the queening restrictions, then that line is still playable for a win, even though a
 * faster winning line may exist.  From the opposing point of view, if the tablebase treats any
 * position where the third pawn queens as a forced win, then the player can be confident that any
 * drawing line can not be improved upon by the superior side.  From a computational perspective, we
 * have reduced the complexity requirements to a point where the calculation can be performed in a
 * reasonable amount of time.  While still too slow for over-the-board use, we now have a useful
 * tool for the analysis of more complex endgames, useful for either static analysis, or for the
 * slow time controls of correspondence games.
 *
 * Hoffman improves upon Freezer with a more sophisticated method of chaining one endgame analysis
 * into another, allowing more realistic modeling of queening combinations and exchanges.  For
 * example, in a bishop vs knight endgame (with pawns), if we can (if we wish) analyze first the
 * king and pawn endgame resulting after a trade of the minors, then use this information to analyze
 * a similar set of king vs knight and king vs bishop endgames, and finally combine all this
 * information together to analyze the bishop vs knight endgame.  While the current version of
 * Freezer can only regard the capture of the knight or bishop as a forced win for one side or the
 * other, Hoffman can look through the exchange to determine the result more accurately.
 *
 * Hoffman thus attempts to combine the best of Nalimov and Freezer.  Unlike Freezer, the program is
 * powerful enough to solve any endgame completely (given enough computing resources), exactly
 * reproducing any Nalimov tablebase.  Unlike Nalimov, the program is capable of pruning pawn moves,
 * queening combinations, movement options and exchanges, giving it Freezer's ability to solve
 * complex endgames in a reasonable amount of time.  The exact tradeoff between the two extremes is
 * made using a XML-based configuration that can seem daunting at first, but ultimately offers the
 * user the ability to extensively tailor the program's operation.  Combined with a human being's
 * common sense and chess judgement, it is my hope that this flexibility with ultimately make the
 * program more useful for endgame retrograde analysis than either Nalimov or Freezer.
 *
 * For those not up on Americana, the program is named after Trevor Hoffman, an All Star baseball
 * pitcher who specializes in "closing" games.  It was written specifically for The World vs. Arno
 * Nickel game.
 *
 *
 * Usage: hoffman -g -o <output-tablebase> <xml-control-file>     (generate mode)
 *        hoffman -v <tablebase> ...                              (verification mode)
 *        hoffman -p <tablebase> ...                              (probe mode)

/***** DATA STRUCTURES *****/

/* position - the data structures that represents a board position
 *
 * There are two kinds of positions: local and global.  Locals are faster but are tied to a specific
 * tablebase.  Globals are more general and are used to translate between different tablebases.
 *
 * Both types use a 64-bit board_vector with one bit for each board position, in addition to a flag
 * to indicate which side is to move and the en passant capture square (or -1 if no en passant
 * capture is possible).  We use board_vector to easily check if possible moves are legal by looking
 * for pieces that block our moving piece.  This is done during futurebase propagation (mobile
 * capture only), during intratable propagation, and during initialization.  It could be used to
 * check if en passant positions are legal (are the two squares behind the pawn blocked or not), but
 * that is problematic now because the board_vector isn't correct at the point where we need to
 * make that check.
 *
 * Local positions use numbers (0-63) indicating the positions of the mobile pieces, and also have a
 * quick way to check captures using a black_vector and a white_vector.  You have to look into the
 * tablebase structure to figure out what piece corresponds to each number.  "black_vector" and
 * "white_vector" are only used during tablebase initialization and in the probe code.  It's
 * starting to look like these vectors would be better arranged as PTM_vector and PNTM_vector
 * (player to move and player not to move).
 *
 * It makes sense to include these vectors in the position structures because it's easiest to
 * compute them in the routines that convert indices to positions, but if you alter the position,
 * then they get out of sync, and its tempting to just leave them that way because you rarely need
 * them to be right at that point.  This really came back to haunt me when implementing en passant.
 *
 * Global positions contain an 8x8 unsigned char array with ASCII characters representing each
 * piece.
 *
 * Sometimes I allow the board vectors, black_vector and white_vector to get out of sync with the
 * position (for speed).  This can be a problem, so it has to be done really carefully.
 *
 * We don't worry about moving a piece that's pinned on our king, for example.  The resulting
 * position will already have been flagged illegal in the table.

/**** TABLEBASE STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS ****/

/* The 'xml' in the tablebase is authoritative; much of the other info is extracted from it
 * for efficiency.
 *
 * movecnt - 0 if this entry is ready to propagate; 255 if it has been propagated
 *
 * While movecnt is > 0, it is the number of moves FORWARD from this position that haven't been
 * analyzed yet.  The other three numbers are the number of moves out of this position for which
 * white wins, for which black wins, for which there is some kind of draw.
 *
 * If this position is WHITE TO MOVE, then we don't have to count outcomes which are WHITE WINS,
 * since that makes this position WHITE WINS.  We only have to count outcomes which are BLACK WINS,
 * in order to conclude that, if all possible white moves result in BLACK WINS, then this position
 * is BLACK WINS.  If at least one move leads to a draw (other moves lead to BLACK WINS), then the
 * position is WHITE DRAWS.  If all moves lead to draws, then the position is also BLACK DRAWS.
 * Since we assume that white will make the best move, then we can just say that this position DRAWS
 * unless either there is at least one move which leads to WHITE WINS, or if all moves lead to BLACK
 * WINS.
 *
 * So, all we really need is movecnt.  If we backtrace from a single WHITE WINS, then this position
 * becomes WHITE WINS.  If we backtrace from BLACK WINS, we decrement movecnt.  If movecnt reaches
 * zero, then the position becomes BLACK WINS.  When we're all done backtracing possible wins,
 * anything left with a non-zero movecnt is a DRAW.
 *
 * We also need a mate-in count and a stalemate (conversion) count.
 *
 * To make this work for either white or black positions, let's adopt the notation PTM (Player to
 * move) and PNTM (Player not to move)
 *
 * movecnt
 * 255 - ILLEGAL POSITION
 * 254 - PTM WINS; propagation done
 * 253 - PNTM WINS; propagation done
 * 252 - PTM WINS; propagation needed
 * 0   - PNTM WINS; propagation needed
 *
 * 1 through 251 - movecnt (during run), or DRAW (after run is finished)

     *
     * Initially, this function can be very simple (multiplying numbers together), but to build
     * smaller tables it can be more precise.
     *
     * For example, two kings can never be next to each other.  Pieces can never be on top of each
     * other, or on top of static pieces.  The side to move can not be in check.
     *
     * It also updates the position's board_vector (which doesn't have to be valid going in),
     * but not the white_vector or black_vector.  It does this to check for illegal en passant
     * positions.
     *
     * Returns either an index into the table, or -1 (probably) if the position is illegal.
     *
     * What exactly is an illegal position?  Well, for starters, one that index_to_local_position()
     * reports as illegal, because that's the function that initialize_tablebase() uses to figure
     * which positions need to be flagged illegal, and the program screams if you try to back prop
     * into one of them.  Since global_position_to_index() is also used to generate indices during
     * back prop, its idea of illegality also has to match with index_to_local_position().  And
     * since index_to_global_position() is used to decide which futurebase positions to back prop to
     * begin with, its idea of legality also has to consistent.
     *
     * This function is currently used only during back propagation to generate indices, and during
     * probing to convert "next move" positions into indices.
     *
     * When we back propagate a local position from either a futurebase or intratable, we generate
     * en passant positions simply by running through the pawns on the fourth and fifth ranks.  If
     * we don't look then to see if there was a piece behind the "en passant" pawn (that would have
     * prevented it from moving), and we currently don't (correctly) because the board vectors
     * aren't set right, then we have to detect that and return -1 here.  Otherwise, we would try to
     * back propagate to a position that had been labeled illegal during initialization by
     * index_to_local_position().
     *
     * This function is also used during probing to see if possible next positions are legal.

     * e3) by simply ignoring e3e4 as a possible move.
     *
     * Pruning an opponent's move is more complex because we step a half-move into the future and
     * consider our own next move.  This costs us little, since we can control our own move and
     * therefore don't have to consider all possibilities, and improves a lot.  If future tables
     * exist for any of our responses, they are used.  If no such future tables exist, then the move
     * is regarded as a lost game.
     *
     * So, --prune-his-move e7e8 prunes a pawn promotion (assuming a static pawn on e7) by
     * considering all possible positions resulting after the pawn promotion (to either Q or N) AND
     * the answering move.  The resulting game is regarded as a win for white unless both Q and N
     * promotions have an answer that leads to another table with a win or draw for black.
     *
     * For example, let's say we're looking at a Q-and-P vs. Q-and-P endgame.  There are four mobile
     * pieces (2 Ks and 2 Qs), so we can handle this.  But if one of the pawns queens, then we've
     * got a game with five mobile pieces, and that's too complex.  But we don't want to completely
     * discard all possible enemy promotions, if we can immediately capture the new queen (or the
     * old one).  So we specify something like --prune-his-move e7e8 and pass in a tablebase for a
     * Q-and-P vs. Q endgame.
     *
     * We also check for immediate checkmates or stalemates.
     *
     * Question: do we really need to flag this at all?  Probably yes, because we don't want this
     * pruning to occur by accident.
     *
     * Another reason to flag it is that we want to label in the file header that this pruning was
     * done.  In particular, if we use a pruned tablebase to compute another (earlier) pruned
     * tablebase, we want to make sure the pruning is consistent, i.e. "our" side has to stay the
     * same.  This can only be guaranteed if we explicitly flag which side is which in the file
     * header.
     *
     * Pruning doesn't affect the size of the resulting tablebase.  We discard the extra
     * information.  If the pruned move is actually made in the game, then you have to calculate all
     * possible next moves and check your tablebases for them.  This seems reasonable.

 * If we're back propagating from a simple capture, we can use local positions fairly easily.  If

 * the en passant square set, then we process not only that position, but also any positions just
 * like it that have en passant set.  The idea being that we set en passant if we actually need it,

/* initialize_tablebase()
 *
 * This is another critical function; don't be deceived by the tame word 'initialize'.
 *
 * We determine that a position is won for the player not to move (PNTM) if all possible moves (of
 * the player to move) lead to a won game for PNTM.  We count down this total during back
 * propagation, so it stands to reason that we need an accurate count to start with.  Thus the
 * importance of this function.
 *
 * Basically, there are two types of moves we need to consider in each position:
 *
 * 1. non-capture moves of the mobile pieces
 *
 * Normally, we just add these up and then count them down during intra-table propagation.  The only
 * extra issue that arises is the possibility of move restrictions.  If the "good guys" are PTM,
 * then we can just ignore any possible moves outside the restriction - we don't count them up here,
 * and we don't count them down later.  If the "bad guys" are PTM, then any possible move outside
 * the restriction immediately results in this routine flagging the position won for PTM...  unless
 * we want to step forward another half move.  (How?)
 *
 * 2. non-capture moves of the frozen pieces and capture/promotion moves
 *
 * These always lead to a different tablebase (a futurebase).  The only way we handle them is
 * through inter-table back propagation.  We keep a seperate count of these moves (the
 * "futuremoves"), because, unlike non-capture moves of mobile pieces, we might miss some of these
 * moves if we don't have a complete set of futurebases.  So we count futuremoves by themselves (as
 * well as part of the standard count), and count them down normally during a single sweep through
 * our futurebases.  If that takes care of everything fine.  Otherwise, during our first pass
 * through the current tablebase, we'll find that some of the futuremoves remain unaccounted for.
 * If they occur with the "good guys" as PTM, we just double-check that the restriction is OK,
 * subtract the remaining futuremoves out from the standard count, and keep going.  But if the "bad
 * guys" are PTM, then some more work is needed.  The position is marked won for PTM, unless we want
 * to step forward another half move.  In this case, we compute all possible next moves (or maybe
 * just captures), and search for them in our tablebases.  If any of them are marked drawn or won,
 * we can safely back-propagate this.  Otherwise, the position has to be marked won for PTM, as
 * before.
 *
 * There's a real serious speed penalty here, because this half-move-forward algorithm requires
 * random access lookups in the futurebases.  A possible way to address this would be to create an
 * intermediate tablebase for the half move following the capture/promotion.  This could be done by
 * building a tablebase with a queen (and another one with a knight) frozen on the queening square.
 * Any possible move of the queen or knight would result in a win for the moving side.  A similar
 * shortcut could be done for a capture, though the only real justification (from a performance
 * perspective) would be on promotions.
