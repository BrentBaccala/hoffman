	   Hoffman - retrograde analysis for chess endgames

Hoffman is a very compute-intensive program that uses 64-bit integer
operations extensively.  If you're running on a 64-bit processor,
something like an Intel Core 2, I'd suggesting configuring with an
appropriate CFLAGS to take advantage of your processor's features:

	CFLAGS="-march=core2 -O3" ./configure

or something similar (assuming that you're using GCC).

To get started, I recommend reading the following:

tutorial.pdf - The Hoffman Tutorial
reference.pdf - The Hoffman Reference

and then experimenting with the program.

Most developer documentation is in the source code; also read
proptables.pdf and TODO.
