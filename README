	   Hoffman - retrograde analysis for chess endgames

Hoffman is a very compute-intensive program that uses 64-bit integer
operations extensively.

Before compiling the program, make sure you've installed the various
packages used by the program.  On Ubuntu, you need:

   - autoconf-archive (to avoid weird autoconf message https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8811381#comment72663526_9024469

   - g++
   - libboost-all-dev
   - zlib1g-dev
   - libxml++2.6-dev
   - libreadline-dev
   - libxml2-utils (for xmllint)
   - libxml-libxml-perl (for genctlfile.pl)

Next, if you're compiling from a tar file, running 'configure' and
then 'make' to build the program.  If you're compiling from the git
repository, run 'autoreconf -i' before 'configure'.

To get started, I recommend reading the following:

tutorial.pdf - The Hoffman Tutorial
reference.pdf - The Hoffman Reference

and then experimenting with the program.

http://tablebase.sesse.net/ is currently a good place to get pre-built
tablebases, in both Nalimov and Syzygy formats.

Most developer documentation is in the source code; also read TODO.
