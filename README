	   Hoffman - retrograde analysis for chess endgames

To get started, I recommend reading the following:

tutorial.pdf - The Hoffman Tutorial
reference.pdf - The Hoffman Reference

and then experimenting with the program.

Most developer documentation is in the source code; also read
proptables.pdf and TODO.
