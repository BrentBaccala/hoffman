Nalimov encoding scheme

rgsHalfKings[blackKing][whiteKing] : 0 - 1805
   white king restricted to left half of board

rgsTriKings[blackKing][whiteKing] : 0 - 461
   white king restricted to a1-d1-d4 triangle, if on a1-d1 diagonal,
   then black king restricted to a1-h1-h8 triangle

rgprgsqPiece[PieceType][blackKing][whitePiece]
   this table enumerates all possible positions of the black king and the white piece,
   excluding overlaps and capture positions where the white piece can assuredly
   (i.e, adjacent squares) capture the black king

   numbering restarts at 0 for each king position
   piece squares (0-63 or 8-55), excluding cases above, in that order
   if whitePiece is none (blackPawn), then only exclude overlaps

rgcLegal[PieceType][blackKing]
   how many legal entries are there in rgprgsqPiece for this piece type and king position

rgprgulSinglePawnPresent[PieceType][encoding]  (encoding 0-1805)
rgprgulSinglePawnless[PieceType][encoding]  (encoding 0-461)
   maps encoded king position to base single-piece index
   each index increments by rgcLegal[PieceType][blackKing],
      minus one if the white king can legally be on the white piece's square


21-piece encoding - white to move
  reflection (modified if TB is inverted)
  ind from rgprgsqPiece, based on PieceType and position of black king
  subtract one from ind if white king could be on piece's square, and piece's square > white king's square
  add rgprgulSingle...[] to essentially space out king encoding to make room for piece numbering in LSB

21-piece encoding - black to move
  if no pawn
    reflection
    king encoding * 62, plus piece location, EXCLUDE2 to subtract out white and black king squares
