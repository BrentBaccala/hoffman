Hoffman is a program to solve chess endgames using retrograde
analysis, which is much different from conventional computer chess
programs.  Retrograde analysis is only useful in the endgame, runs
very slowly, and produces enormous amounts of data.  Its great
advantage lies in its ability to completely solve the endgame.  In a
very real sense, a retrograde engine has no ``move horizon'' like a
conventional chess engine.  It sees everything.  For those not up on
Americana, the program is named after Trevor Hoffman, an All Star
baseball pitcher who specializes in ``closing'' games.  It was written
specifically for The World vs. Arno Nickel game.

Hoffman uses XML extensively both for configuring its operation and
for labeling the resulting tablebases.  In fact, a completed Hoffman
tablebase (typically in an {\tt .htb} file) is just a {\tt gzip}-ed
file that contains an XML prefix followed by binary tablebase data (in
a format specified by the XML).  Basically, to operate Hoffman, you
write an XML file that specifies the analysis you want done, then feed
it to the program.  As output, it produces a modified version of the
XML input that includes binary tablebase data appended at the end.

\section{Hoffman and Pawngen}

A single Hoffman tablebase contains a fixed number and type of pieces,
which can be placed onto different squares of the chessboard.  For
example, a ``kqkp'' tablebase typically contains all possible chess
positions that can be formed using a white king and queen as well as a
black king and pawn.  It does {\it not} contain any positions that
contain just a black king without a black pawn.  Captures, promotions,
and movements outside of a piece's allowed squares are handled by
consulting other tablebases, called {\it futurebases}, which must
already exist.  It is also possible to handle such moves without
futurebases by {\it pruning} them.

Creating and managing an interlinked set of tablebase control files
can be quite daunting.  Hoffman includes an auxiliary program called
``pawngen'' to aid in this process.  Pawngen takes an Hoffman-format
XML control file as input, considers all possible tablebases that can
result, and outputs a directory full of correctly interlinked XML
control files, ready for Hoffman, along with a UNIX standard makefile
to construct them in the proper order.  Pawngen currently accepts only
a subset of Hoffman's XML syntax --- no {\tt location} attributes are
allowed on any non-pawns, and pawns must have {\tt location}
attributes specifying a specific starting square followed by a plus
sign.  Pawngen does understand {\tt futurebase} and {\tt prune}
elements, and will use them to truncate its analysis and thus limit
the number of generated control files.  Also, pawgen understands the
{\tt pawngen-condition} attribute on {\tt prune} elements, which can
be used to prune more selectively than otherwise possible.

Put simply, pawngen considers individual pawn formations and pawn
moves (including captures and promotions), while allowing the other
pieces to move freely around the board.  Hoffman, on the other hand,
can only consider one set of pieces at a time, requiring futurebases
to handle captures and promotions.  Furthermore, for Hoffman to
compute the complicated changes in pawn formation that can result from
various captures would require fairly unrestricted pawn locations that
would produce prohibitively large tablebases.

\vfil\eject

Unlike Hoffman, which is written in C, pawngen is a Perl script, so
you must have Perl installed (along with its {\tt XML::LibXML} module)
in order to use it.  Calling Hoffman in the correct order on a
directory containing hundreds of control files is a job for ``make''.
Both Perl and make are fairly standard on Linux and other UNIX
variants.  On Microsoft systems, I've used the cygwin distribution
(which includes both programs) successfully.

\section{Parallel Processing with Hoffman}

A Hoffman analysis can be quite compute-intensive.  The program can be
compiled to use POSIX threads (if available), with the number of
threads specified at run-time using the {\tt -p} option.  The program
is also designed to use multiple computers in parallel, all working
simultaneously on an analysis.  This is accomplished by breaking the
analysis up into smaller pieces, each with its own XML configuration
file.  The primary support provided by the program is the ability to
use URLs instead of filenames to reference tablebases, allowing
tablebases to be stored on a server accessable over a network.  A
basic Perl CGI script ({\tt hoffman.cgi}) is provided which, when
installed on a web server and supplied with a directory full of
Hoffman XML files, will hand them out in the proper order to Hoffman
clients for processing.

\section{Propagation tables}

A Hoffman analysis can also be quite space-intensive.  Since its
memory utilization pattern is basically random, Hoffman will begin to
swap dramatically and suffer a disastrous drop in performance once its
working set size exceeds the machine's available memory.  To alleviate
this, the program can be operated in a mode where it fills a series of
{\it propagation tables}, writing each one out to disk when full, then
reads them back in sequentially during the next pass.  Although less
efficient than when the working set can be contained in memory,
propagation tables allow the program to build tablebases of
essentially unlimited size with no swapping and reasonable CPU
utilization.  This mode is activated at run-time by specifying the
size of the propagation tables (in MB) with the {\tt -P} switch.

\section{XML Syntax}

The root XML element in a Hoffman tablebase is always {\tt
<tablebase>}.  Its only attribute ({\tt offset}) is added by the
program, should not be supplied by the user, and indicates a
hexadecimal byte-offset into the file where the binary tablebase data
begins.

Within a {\tt <tablebase>} the following elements may
occur in the listed order (deprecated elements and attributes are not
documented):

\subsection{\tt <prune-enable color="white|black" type="concede|discard"/>}

Specifies which kinds of pruning elements will be allowed in this
tablebase and its futurebases.  Both attributes are required.  {\tt
concede} means wins may be conceded to the named color; {\tt discard}
means moves by the named color may be discarded.  At most one {\tt
prune-enable} can be specified for each color.  No {\tt prune-enable}
element is required, however, no {\tt prune} elements are allowed without
one and no futurebases may possess additional {\tt prune-enable}
elements beyond those specified for the current tablebase.


\subsection{\tt <variant name="normal|suicide"/>}

The optional {\tt <variant>} element specifies which version
of the rules of chess apply to this tablebase.

{\bf Default:} {\tt normal}


\subsection{\tt <index type="naive|naive2|simple|compact|no-en-passant|combinadic \hfil\break\hbox{\qquad} |combinadic2|combinadic3" symmetry="1|2|4|8"/>}

The {\tt <index>} element specifies the algorithm that will be used to
compute the index numbers in the tablebase; i.e, the algorithm that
will convert board positions into tablebase offsets and vice versa.
It typically is not specified by the user (but can be).

\begin{description}

\item {\tt naive} uses $2^{6n+1}$ indices to store positions for $n$ pieces.
It assigns a single bit for the side-to-move flag, then assigns 6 bits
to each piece, which is used to encode a number from 0 to 63,
indicating the piece's position on the board.

\item {\tt naive2} Differs from {\tt naive} in its handling of multiple
identical pieces, which it stores as a base and an offset, thus saving
a single bit.  Currently, only pairs of identical pieces are handled;
a fatal error will result if there are more than two identical pieces.

\item {\tt simple} Like {\tt naive}, but only assigns numbers to
squares that are legal for a particular piece.  Slower to compute than
{\tt naive}, but more compact for tablebases with lots of movement
restrictions on the pieces.

\item {\tt compact} A combination of the delta encoding used for
identical pieces in {\tt naive2}, the encoding of restricted pieces used
in {\tt simple}, plus a paired encoding of the kings so they can never be
adjacent.

\item {\tt no-en-passant} An enhancement of {\tt compact} that uses
the paired encoding scheme for pawns restricted to the same file.
Since they can never pass each other, we can encode them as if they
were an identical pair, then assign their colors in the same order
they were originally specified.  En passant significantly complicates
this and can not be handled with this scheme.

\end{description}

The optional {\tt symmetry} attribute can be used to encode multiple
positions using a single entry, but its utility depends upon the exact
analysis being done.  A tablebase with no pawns and no movement
restrictions can be encoded with 8-way symmetry,
since the board can be rotated about a horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal axis without affecting the behavior of the pieces.  A
tablebase with pawns can utilize at most 2-way
symmetry, since only a reflection about a vertical axis preserves
piece behavior.  A tablebase with restrictions on the positions of the
pieces (say, frozen pawns) can not use any symmetry at all.
Not all symmetries are compatible will all index types; for example,
8-way symmetry can not be used with {\tt naive} or {\tt naive2}
index types.

{\bf Default:} {\tt combinadic3} with automatically selected symmetry

\subsection{Tablebase format}

The next three elements specify the format of the tablebase entries.
At most one of them can be specified.

{\tt <dtm bits={\it integer}/>} specifies a {\it distance to mate}
metric occupying either one or two bytes.  Zero is used for draws, -1
is used for positions where the moving side is checkmated, and 1 is
used for positions where the moving side can capture the opposing
king, so an eight bit dtm field can record mate-in distances up to 126.
If a field size is not specified, it is selected automatically.

{\tt <basic/>} specifies a {\it bitbase} where two bits are used for
each position, and no distance information is stored --- only an
indication of the ultimate outcome (win, lose, or draw).  Such a format
is more compact and requires less time to generate, but requires more
effort to use, since care must be taken to avoid loops when following
winning lines.

{\tt <flag type="white-wins|white-draws"/>} specifies a {\it bitbase}
where only a single bit is used for each position.

{\bf Default:} DTM with automatically selected field size.


\subsection{\tt <piece color="white|black" type="king|queen|rook|bishop|knight|pawn" \hfil\break\hbox{\qquad} location="{\it string}" index-ordering="reverse"/>}

Multiple {\tt piece} elements are used to specify the chess pieces
present in the tablebase. {\tt color} and {\tt type} are required and
should be obvious.  The ordering of {\tt piece} elements is
significant in that it directly affects the index algorithm,
but there is no user-visible effect of the ordering.

The optional {\tt location} attribute restricts the board positions
available to this piece.  It should be a list of squares, in algebraic
notation, on which the piece is to be allowed.  A single square
results in a completely frozen piece.  In addition, pawns may use an
additional syntax consisting of a single starting square followed by a
plus sign, indicating that the pawn may move forward as far as
possible.  This can be used, for example, to locate a black pawn on
{\tt "a7+} and a white pawn on {\tt "a2+"}, indicating that both can
move forward, but they can not ``pass'' each other.

The option {\tt index-ordering="reverse"} attribute may be specified
to indicate that the board positions should be indexed in reverse
order.  At some point, this may be used to optimize futurebase
back-propagation, for example, by reverse indexing a queen so that the
last row comes first.  Currently fairly useless.

\subsection{\tt <futurebase filename="{\it string}" url="{\it string}" colors="invert"/>}

One or more futurebases may be specified with this element.  Either a
{\tt filename} or a {\tt url} may be specified (not both) to locate a
futurebase, which must be another Hoffman tablebase.  It must be
related to the current tablebase in one of the following ways:

\begin{description}
\item It has exactly the same piece configuration as the
current tablebase, and corresponds to movement by one of the
restricted pieces, i.e, the current tablebase has a white pawn frozen
on {\tt e4} and the futurebase has a white pawn frozen on {\tt e5}.

\item It has exactly the same piece configuration as
the current tablebase except that a single piece is missing, i.e,
a capture occurred.

\item It has exactly the same piece configuration as the current
tablebase except that a single pawn has been replaced with a knight,
bishop, rook or queen, i.e, a pawn promoted.

\item It has exactly the same piece configuration as the current
tablebase except that a single pawn has been replaced with a knight,
bishop, rook or queen, and a single non-pawn of the opposite color has
been removed, i.e, a pawn captured and promoted in the same move.

\end{description}

The option {\tt colors="invert"} attribute may be specified to indicate
that the piece colors of the futurebase should be inverted as it is
processed.  This precludes the need to calculate, say, a tablebase
with a white queen and a black rook as well as a tablebase with a
black queen and a white rook.  The first may be used (with this
option) as a futurebase to calculate a tablebase with two white rooks
and a black queen.

{\bf Note:} Any futurebase {\tt prune-enable} elements must be a subset of
the current tablebase's {\tt prune-enable} elements.

{\bf Note:} The only {\tt url} scheme currently supported for this
element is {\tt ftp}.

\subsection{\tt <prune color="white|black" move="{\it string}" type="concede|discard" \hfil\break\hbox{\qquad} pawngen-condition="{\it perl-expression}"/>}

Futuremoves not handled by specifying futurebases must be pruned using
one or more of these elements, or an error will result.  All three
attributes are required.  The {\tt move} is specified using regular
expression syntax to match a move in a subset of standard algebraic
notation.  All of the following strings are examples of legal {\tt
move} strings in a {\tt prune} element: {\tt Pe5}, {\tt P=Q}, {\tt
RxQ}, {\tt PxR=Q}.  The following regular expressions would all match
{\tt Kd4}: {\tt Kd?}, {\tt K?4}, {\tt K[a-d]4}, {\tt K*}.
The {\tt type} attribute specifies what should be done with matching
moves: treated as wins for the moving side ({\tt concede}), or
completely ignored ({\tt discard}).  If multiple {\tt prune}
elements match a particular move, it is a warning if they have the
same {\tt type}, a fatal error if their {\tt type}s differ.

A single {\tt prune} element may be specified with {\tt
move="stalemate"} and {\tt type="concede"}.  In this case, the {\tt
color} attribute indicates to which side stalemates should be conceded
as wins.

The optional {\tt pawngen-condition} attribute is not allowed directly
by Hoffman, but can be present on control files input to pawngen.  It
specifies a Perl expression to be tested on each position considered
by pawngen --- i.e, every distinct pawn formation with an associated
set of non-pawn pieces.  The prune statement will be included in the
resulting Hoffman control file only if the Perl expression evaluates
true.  The Perl expression is evaluated in the following context: {\tt
@white\_pieces} is an array of one-character strings listing the
non-pawn white pieces, i.e, {\tt ("K", "Q")}; {\tt @white\_pawns} is
an array of two-character strings listing the board squares of the
white pawns, i.e, {\tt ("a4", "c6")}; and likewise for {\tt
@black\_pieces} and {\tt @black\_pawns}.  This context may change
slightly in future releases.

{\bf Note:} If a {\tt prune} element is specified for a futuremove
handled by a futurebase, then the futurebase takes precedence.
However, this case is handled by tracking every futuremove in every
position, so it is possible to specify futurebases that handle a
subset of the possible futuremoves, then use {\tt prune} elements to
handle the rest by default.

{\bf Note:} {\tt prune} elements are only allowed if they match a {\tt
prune-enable} element.  If no {\tt prune-enable} elements were
specified, then no {\tt prune} elements will be permitted.

\subsection{Generation Controls}

These elements are all optional, but if {\tt output} is not specified,
an output filename must be specified on the command line using
the {\tt -o} switch.

\subsubsection{\tt <output filename="{\it string}" url="{\it string}"/>}

At most a single {\tt output} element should be used, with either a
{\tt filename} or a {\tt url} (but not both), to specify where
the finished tablebase should be written.

{\bf Note:} The only {\tt url} scheme currently supported for this
element is {\tt ftp}.

\subsubsection{\tt <completion-report url="{\it string}"/> \hfil\break <error-report url="{\it string}"/>}

If this is specified, the tablebase's XML prefix (without the
tablebase data) will be written to a URL upon either a successful or
error termination of the program.  This capability (along with the
ability to be read and write tablebase URLs) is intended to aid the
construction of Hoffman tablebases using a distributed cluster.

{\bf Note:} In an error termination, every attempt will be made to add
{\tt <error>} elements to the XML indicating the cause of the problem.

{\bf Note:} The only {\tt url} scheme currently supported for these
elements is {\tt http}.

input.  It contains statistics relating to the finished tablebase.

\end{tabular}

\section{Some Confusing Error Messages}

% This section does not attempt to list all of Hoffman's error messages,
% only those anticipated to cause some confusion.

\subsection{Doubled pawns must (currently) appear in board order in piece list}

Currently, doubled pawns using ``plus'' locations (ex: {\tt
location="a2+"}) on the same file must have their {\tt piece} elements
listed in the XML in the order that the pawns appear on the board,
counting in algebraic notation from row 1 to row 8.  I mean, row 2 to
row 7.

\subsection{Piece restrictions not allowed with symmetric indices (yet)}

You can't specify an {\tt index symmetry} attribute and also specify
{\tt piece location} attributes, even if the restrictions on the piece
locations might be compatible with the requested symmetry.

\subsection{Non-identical overlapping piece restrictions not allowed with this index type}

For the {\tt naive}, {\tt naive2}, and {\tt simple} index types, you
can't specify two identical pieces with different {\tt location}
restrictions unless those restrictions are completely distinct.  For
example, you can't have a free white rook and another white rook
restricted to the a-file.  If you think about it, this situation would
allow the rooks to ``trade places'' --- both could move to the a-file
and then either one could move off.  The simpler index types can't
handle this situation.  You could, however, have a white rook
restricted to the a-file and another restricted to the d-file (or use
a more sophisticated index type, like {\tt compact}).

\subsection{More than two identical pieces with overlapping move restrictions}

Identical pieces (say, two white rooks) can be swapped without
changing the position, and the program has to take this into account.
If there were, say, three identical pieces, we'd have to consider a
more complex set of permutations, and the program currently doesn't do
this.  So, unless the pieces have non-overlapping move restrictions
(i.e, they can't be swapped), we're currently limited to two identical
pieces, and thus can't handle something like {\tt kpppkr}.

\subsection{Futurebase doesn't match prune-enables!}

Remember that futurebase {\tt prune-enable} elements must be a
subset of the current tablebase's {\tt prune-enable}s.
