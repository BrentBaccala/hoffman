<chessgames.com>  Will you kindly ask GM Nickel if he will use a computer for this match, and if it has an endgame tablebase?

I've read the majority of the postings so far, and I know you've already answered the question about the legality of computer use, but there has been so much additional discussion on this point that I think we should definitely establish what our opponent will do, not just what the rules say.

Thank you.
