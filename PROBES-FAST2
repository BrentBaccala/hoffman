# Tablebase probe tests - FAST2
#
# "FAST2" is mostly tests on tablebases of naive type.
#
# FAST1, FAST2 and FAST3 are separate so that Travis doesn't time out.
#
# Each line starts with the MD5 hash of the expected output, then a string
# that will be fed to hoffman (escape spaces as '\ ' and newlines as '\\n'),
# then a list of tablebases to be probed, which can include wildcards.
