This code hasn't been maintained since 2006 and is of significantly
poorer quality than the rest of Hoffman.  Use at your risk.

The idea is to load pointers to a bunch of XML files into a SQL
database.  This is done with loaddb, which expects to be fed a
dependencies list in Makefile-like format.

Then you put the XML files on an FTP server somewhere.  They have to
all point to the FTP server for their futurebases and output files;
this isn't done by the scripts.  Point several copies of Hoffman on
different machines at hoffman.cgi and they should fetch and run the
next XML files in the right order.

verifydb is there to fix the SQL database when it gets screwed up.
